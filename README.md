# Java-GraphSearchGoogle
This is a coursera course project.
[Link to the Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming)
The project is to build a mapping application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map.

## Code design
The  code you’ll be developing here is what’s called “back-end” code, in that  you’ll be working with road data, but not directly with the front-end interface.  Separating the back-end functionality from the front end interface is a very common software engineering practice, and in this class the ideas we're learning fit firmly into this back-end functionality.  But just developing back-end code can be dry, so we provide you with a front end map interface that uses the Google Maps API.  This interface may look like Google Maps, but it needs your code to work!   By the end of the course, you'll have built something that really looks and feels like Google Maps!   Admittedly, it will be quite primitive compared to the real Google Maps, but hey, you're just one person coding for one month (and part-time, at that).  The real Google Maps took months or years to develop with a team of many professional engineers.

## What I have learned
* Implement Graphs in Java from scratch.
* Implement basic graph search algorithms including breadth first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A* Search.
* Evaluate the performance of different graph search algorithms in different contexts.
* Work with real-world geographic road data
